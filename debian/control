Description: OsmoMSC: Osmocom's Mobile Switching Center for 2G and 3G circuit-switched mobile networks
  The Mobile Switching Center (MSC) is the heart of 2G/3G
  circuit-switched services.  It terminates the A-interface links from the
  Base Station Controllers (BSC) and handles the MM and CC sub-layers of
  the Layer 3 protocol from the phones (MS).
  .
  This Osmocom implementation of the MSC handles A interfaces via 3GPP
  AoIP in an ASP role.  It furthermore implements IETF MGCP against an
  external media gateway, such as OsmoMGW.  It does *not* implement MAP
  towards a HLR, but the much simpler Osmocom GSUP protocol, which can
  be translated to MAP if needed.
